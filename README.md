This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Features üéØü•áüèÜ
* [x] The user can see the top 20 "Currently Playing" movies on a page.
* [x] For each movie, the user can see the Movie Title, Year, Rating, and Poster.
* [] The user can see this information clearly on devices of various screen sizes.
* [x] The user can see "more" movies by tapping a "See More" button at the bottom.

## Rockets üöÄ
* [] The user can enter a term into a search box to filter the currently loaded movies by search term. E.g.; the user can type "mar" and the results are reduced to show "Captain Marvel".
* [] The user can change the "source" from "Currently Playing" movies to "Top Rated" movies (or any other of the endpoints supplied by MovieDB).
* [] Sort by Rating and Popularity (from Lowest to Highest and Vice Versa)

* [] In addition to Previous and Next, use Number Pagination. Click on Number 3 will get them to Page3 and display movies 61st - 79th.

* [] For each movie, include a link (movie/id) to display the full Movie Info on another page (URL). Use React Router for this. You'll also have to figure out how to retrieve the parameters from the URL.

* [] Have Year, Rating as a slider. Change the display dynamically when the slider is changed. You could use React Input Range package for this task.
